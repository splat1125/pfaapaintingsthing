This is an example resource pack to show how to pack custom paintings with your resource pack or make a sepciality custom paintings resource pack. You can load as many different custom painting packs as you like and the painting press will load all the paintings found in loaded packs. 

A few quick notes about editing the resource pack and making it your own:
Edit the pack.mcmeta in a text editor to change the name of your custom pack.
Change the pack.png image to change the image that shows up in game on the resource packs page.
For custom paintings, just ass .png images to folder: assets/bibliocraft/textures/custompaintings/

Custom paintings must be in .png format to work. You can also place sub-folders inside the custom paintings folder and as long as the paintings are .png, the painting press will find them.
